## Notes

1. Coming in with limited javascript experience would have made this a much longer endeavor if it were not for the examples already provided in SQL Injection.
2. SQL Injection 3 probably would have been impossible for myself to solve if not for the session on Thursday, July 27th 2017.
3. Cross Site Scripting 4: The problem was also peculiar in that the blacklist involved all caps or no caps, it did not sufficiently check for character combinations of them.  
4. The answer used in bonus question 1 (Cross Site Scripting 5) worked for bonus question 2 (Cross Site Scripting 6). Going to need to ask what bonus question 1 was looking vs. bonus question 2 during office hours.
